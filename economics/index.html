<![CDATA[<p>once again. my parents have given unto me another life-altering theory, or more, concept that one would usually dismiss immediately but me.. </p> <p>i am now in an insomnial state because of that. ok so now i'm out late.. and my parents are fully aware of it. hell i use their gas half the time. i come home and it's all routine, as if it were 2 in the afternoon instead of 2 in the morning. it was all routine, that's what i figured. what i did <i>not</i> know, was that while i am out, my parents <u>still</u> worry about my whereabouts. sure they let me out, they argue not against that. just the fact that i came home tonight and my dad argued with me with deep eyes saying that being out so late into the night is dangerous.<br><br><b>fact</b>. quik cheks, 711s, and all the other quickie marts out there have been held up and televised more than too many times. <br><br><b>fact</b>. mall have been shot up if not inside, in the parking lots.<br><br><b>fact</b>. cars have crashed </p> <p><b>fact</b>. planes have collided <br><br><b>fact</b>. random muggings and shootings happen. <br><br><b>fact</b>. the odds of these things happening to me or anyone in this area of new jersey seems somewhat close to a million to none.<br><br><b>fact</b>. the fact that there is still a chance (columbine has been shot up. the twin towers have fallen. millions and billions have died due to war. ants have been squashed relentlessly for centuries.. .even milleniums) still presents the idea that you, being one out of 6billion+, could die at any instant. <br><br>damn you parents. <br><br>your worrying at first seems illogical but after thinking about it it's only true. although i, not to be self-focused, fully believe that i can fend for myself, i am not yet at... batman level... and can ward off 6 ninjas with shurikens mad fast in a matter of 3 minutes... but i'm not too worried for myself.. should i be? no. that's just being paranoid. that's what parents are for eh? <br><br>damn -_- it all makes sense now. after the comparing me to other kids, asking me why "it's not an A+, only an A", not buying me the shit i want. the leaving me to myself when it comes to those times when typical white yuppie parents would join in praise and acclamation: "gosh darn it, you're the greatest son ever - " no. it was those parents who spawned the children who became the adults of today who show no consideration for the future of their children. the "he smokes pot but hey, let's give him a car" family. the "he's failing spanish. oh and science. and math.. hey he's fai..... hey son, let's go to six flags!" no. has the world lost true value for the concept of hard work? metamorphisis through tough love, cultivation of independance on one's self and pure emotional and philisophical strength? <br><br>no, i'm not the hercules of mentalities, but more and more people are losing it to weakness. spoiled, smothered, saluted by parents today. these future parents will then spawn even more children - a generation of even more people - afraid to touch the snake because it's "gross", whereas people in the past a couple decades back weren't even moved by the sight of a spider on a table.... <br><br>is time un-jading society? <br><br>... no... it's just conforming society into a pristine world where there are no spots... no blotches of hard work and fearlessness. no need to look down at the dirt and grime because while our parents raise us to look up, we only expect the best, because we are the best and we deserve the best and the best of the best is us because we are the best <br><br>!!! no! <br><br>FACE THE WORLD! LOOK OUTSIDE AND TAKE IN EVERYTHING! <br><br>there are children out there who starve and work for a nickel a day, much more unpraised by parents for graduating high school because one: they have no high school, and most possibly two: because they have no parents! the people that the yuppie generation is slowly cultivating in the cul-de-sacs of america will in the future be the people who denounce the fact that there are people who starve, people who die due to lack of the simple ability to live. open your eyes, you fool, they're not there because they are lazy - they work just as hard as you do times two. they are there because fate laid them there, in a world without ups - <b>only downs</b> it is the parents who whip you into shape by psychologically torturing you - toughening your proverbial emotional skin into hide that can endure the wildest of barrages that life can throw towards your way. embrace the concept of tough love and hard work and independence that your parents may <s>throw at you</s> provide you with. there are very few people left who can truly explain the reason for bitter parents... but the purpose of these people is to balance out those people who do nothing to better the world - who enjoy the fruits of life only to spit the seeds out for some other guy to clean up... <br><br>embrace the development of yourself through tough love, because from it you become strong. roll with the punches, glide through the wind, leave your eyes open when you take the fall... because after you do, there won't be much in life that you can't go through without fearless determination and productive ambition... <br><br><br><br>yeh..... i'm gonna go eat my dinner.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<P>my original intention was just to put up an old blog from two years ago.</P> <P>apparently, i screwed that good.</P> <P>i experienced some sort of enlightenment a couple days ago, i never had the incentive to do something about it.&nbsp; now that i've stayed awake for a good 12 hours now, (having slept for all of yesterday) my bum ass felt bored...</P> <P>get this: people only trash other people because they're in someone else's territory.&nbsp; think about it, it seems logical - some sort of <B>defense mechanism</B>.&nbsp; people don't 'hate cuz they jealous yo', who the hell in their right mind does that. really. there's a deeper trigger than just jealousy that initiates on of the deadly sins.. <P>asians in america: "all those damn asians are smart as fuck"<BR>mexicans in america: "all those mexicans work like fuck"<BR>blacks in america: "all those blacks are tall as fuck"<BR>whites in america: "all those whites are white as fuck"</P> <P>don't be arrogant, don't just say "oh, you're just jealous".&nbsp; screw off idiot, i've heard that before.&nbsp; maybe that's not the case, you don't hate on someone for being in your territory because you're jealous of them.. "oh that bum, he should get a fuckin job" - <B>yeah, you're jealous because he's... broke?&nbsp; </B>no.</P> <P><B><I>and when people do hate because they're jealous.&nbsp; oh, you're just fuckin sad, boyo.&nbsp; get your ass up and do something.</B></I></P> <P>you're not what you talk trash about, because it's not you, you're not familiar to it - it's foreign to your 'self'.&nbsp; you see some short kid kick ass at basketball and something clicks in your head 'something is wrong'</P> <P>but let's say one day someone with a problem with mexicans goes to mexico.&nbsp; he sees the life there and how things are.&nbsp; he realizes, (well, chance in hell he realizes) that down to the grit and bone it's all the same - people work to get by they make a living by making a living.&nbsp; so does he.&nbsp; so does everyone else in this world...&nbsp; he feels comfortble knowing this and suddenly, he may be on a lower plane than before or, they are re-elevated to what normal plane he should have seen them on before&nbsp;- his.</P> <P>everyone is the same (fight club).&nbsp; everyone has a job or will have a job or did have a job that contributed to society.&nbsp; those who don't are either unfortunate or just lazy rabbitasses.&nbsp; but that leaves one to wonder, is there a 'occupation'... a fate that may hold not a regular joe job, but a task that involves something greater than keeping someone's checkbook, making cheeseburgers, or arresting crooks at night...&nbsp; what else is there to do other than to wake up in the morning and go to bed at night...&nbsp; what else is there to see other than the sun during the day... what else is there to think other than what is relevant to what goes on during the day...&nbsp; </P> <P>humans have the potential to learn as toddlers, conceive babies as adults, pass on culture as elders.&nbsp; everyone has this potential, but not everyone exercises it.&nbsp; if this is true, there must be a higher potential that not everyone who learns, conceives, and passes culture exercises.&nbsp; but what?&nbsp; what is it that this higher potential can allow?&nbsp; there is something more to life than stopping at red and going at green, it's the click in our heads that make us stop and go.&nbsp; it's the spark that drives us to move - there is something behind it.&nbsp; it is the one with that higher potential and drive who will figure out just what it is... and how to exercise it.&nbsp; </P> <P>btw, the book The Giver...&nbsp; being made into a movie.&nbsp; ;heh..</P> <P>p.s.&nbsp; (open your eyes, because the clouds are moving behind you.)</P>]]>

<![CDATA[<EM>Ok.. I hear what you're saying, but here's what I think. My theory is this: Ppl trash ppl 'cuz they feel as if they can. They have opinions &amp; w/ that they elaborate w/ degrading words &amp; whatever foul word they could come up w/ in the next few seconds. True, there is that underlying trigger that maybe the victim of whom they're attacking is possibly endangering their territory, but that doesn't apply to every "hateful" situation.&nbsp; I would include competition as another source of "trash talking" and jealousy as well. Some envy Asians 'cuz we're stereotyped to be some sort of race who holds the key to the&nbsp;highest degree of intellegence known to mankind. You could also say that some are threatened that Mexicans are going to take over the job force, as a support to your&nbsp;"defense mechanism" theory. Or simply, ppl are just so consumed w/ anger (from wherever it once came) that they just don't know&nbsp; what to do w/ themselves, but to rant on some random bystander in the streets of NYC. Yup.. Ppl are just flat out angry.</EM>]]>

<![CDATA[<FONT color=#4b4b20><B>"if you want to be treated like a grown-up, then behave like a grown-up!" - my parents, oh.. two or three years ago..<BR><BR></B><B>monday:</B> middle school graduation.<BR><B>tuesday:</B> high school graduation.<BR><BR>what a coincidence. they were both at the high school. they both had the same presenters. they both had speeches. they both had graduation gowns. difference?<BR><BR>the middle school graduation emphasized the concepts they learned in middle school. the speech given at the high school graduation expressed how what was learned in high school prepared them for the life after. i've seen 8th graders condone each other because they will miss each other... and i've seen 12th graders congratulate each other because of what they went through, experienced - mutually. <B>don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened</B><BR><BR><B>the gift if growing up is knowing the world.</B> you can't give a puppy the scent of cocaine and expect it to sniff out the tijuana cartel. as you go through each day, you learn alot. or, you're provided with that opportunity at least... do you know the value of patience? do you know the value of fortitude? do you know the value of justice? do you know the value of wisdom? the four virtues; only through expericne can you truly <I>value a value</I>. <BR><BR><B>why upperclassmen seem to always hate freshmen.</B> when you're a freshman, you don't ask questions. you don't brag, you don't test, you don't act like you've been to the moon and back. because you haven't. the upperclassmen know this because they were there. "the freshmen-on-the-bus rule".. "we've all had to ride the bus". is it just that we weren't as privileged as the kiddies are nowadays? when freshmen give even the sophomores attitude, it is <I>never</I> taken lightly. by majority's standards at least.<BR><BR><B>"he's only worked here a week and he acts like he owns the joint!"</B> the same goes for real life. i guess that's how high school prepares you for real life; a microcosm filled with the same status-based rankings real life demands from society. <B>"we thought we left the war back home, when it was waiting for us right here" - Gangs of New York</B> it's like you can't change society. being flamboyant and cocky like you control the world - people look down on that because you can't control the world.. i guess that's another thing you learn in high school. the world works in routine. you can't change the demands from life, you can only change the way you give it what you've got.<BR><BR><B>"that kid gives me a lip, i'm cuttin his into two!"</B> bottom line? you ain't got <B>nuttin</B> until you realize you ain't got <B>nuttin</B>. and when you realize that, you'll find the same thing people found in you. if you've already found the previous, you'd most likely agree that this is how life works. it's like a clock, life doesn't care when you're born or dead. like a mega-corporation, there will always be more people to feed off of.<BR><BR><B>what's the point, if we all live and die and time goes on?</B>. again, man.. it's not what you do, it's how you do it. it's not who you impress, it's how you make the impression. you can impress the world, but the world will forget you. you can make a good impression on someone, and that person will remember you as a great person forever. you can make a bad impression on someone, and that person will remember you as a total idiot forever. it's your choice. give it some thought. for the sake of man-kind, <I>please</I>.<BR><BR>anyways.. on a lighter note, one time for the class of 2005.<BR><FONT color=#000000 size=3><B>C<FONT color=#ff0000>O<FONT color=#000000>N<FONT color=#ff0000>G<FONT color=#000000>R<FONT color=#ff0000>A<FONT color=#000000>T<FONT color=#ff0000>U<FONT color=#000000>L<FONT color=#ff0000>A<FONT color=#000000>T<FONT color=#ff0000>I<FONT color=#ff0000>O<FONT color=#000000>N<FONT color=#ff0000>S<FONT color=#ff0000><BR>C<FONT color=#000000>L<FONT color=#ff0000>A<FONT color=#000000>S<FONT color=#ff0000>S <FONT color=#000000>O<FONT color=#ff0000>F<FONT color=#000000> 2<FONT color=#ff0000>0<FONT color=#000000>0<FONT color=#ff0000>5</FONT></B></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>]]>

<![CDATA[<P>heya cuz, just noticed you dropped me a msg in my g-book, so i'm returning the favour =)</P> <P>so you graduate this year? had no idea, congrats!!! i graduated from 4 years of (overpriced, but) priceless university myself just&nbsp;a couple weeks ago. feels strange that i can't call myself a 'student' anymore... but i'm dropping that label to pick up the 'teacher' label, at least temporarily&nbsp;- i'm leaving at the end of july to go teach english in japan for a year =) dunno if my mom told your mom yet, but yeah... i'll be living on my own and getting paid some real self-sustaining income for once. if you ever plan on visiting japan in the next year, for whatever reason, let me know =) but neway, keep in touch, stay strong and positive - seems like you've been doing a damn good job of that so far anyhow - and take care =)</P>]]>

You are a bit tactless and rude if you don't learn to moderate your constant broadcasting around those whose opinions may be a bit more on the conservative side. You are interesting and attractive. You can be either shy, sensitive, gentle and patient or enthusiastic and lively with a tendency to be exhibitionists. Both types are strong willed and forceful in its own way. You are very opinionated with strong convictions and fight for what you believe. You are farsighted and innovative. You are generally without prejudice and quite tolerant of others' point of view.<BR><BR>You are truly humane and known to be frank and outspoken. You are refined and idealistic, romantic and practical, personable and likable person. Being quick in mind and responding, you love activity and are quite reasonable in that. You cherish and guard your independence and are a strange mixture of caring concern and cool detachment. You will go out of your way to help when needed but will never get emotionally involved.<BR><BR><SPAN class=blackbodybold>Aquarius Male</SPAN><BR>A typical Aquarius male is generally taller than the average person with long bone structure and a strong, solid build. You have a rugged profile and broad, high forehead. You are quite guarded in revealing or expressing your feelings. You have a wide range of interests but are especially interested and attracted to unknown and unknowable. You are a man of exceedingly fair and upright mind and have your very own unshakeable personal moral code that you will refuse to deviate from no matter what.<BR><BR>In love relationships<SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"></SPAN><A class=yellowarticleselected href="http://www.datingmatchmakers.com/love/love-relationship-consideration.aspx" target=_new></A>, for Aquarius male mind contact is a necessity for sexual fulfillment. You are generous, open and sincere to those you care about. You like to get involved in your mates' interests. You are somewhat shy and will often wait for someone else to make the first move. You can't live in a relationship that is domineering or restrictive in any way. Although you appear to be cool outwardly but are quite emotional and tender at heart. When its time to lovemaking<SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"></SPAN><A class=yellowarticleselected href="http://www.datingmatchmakers.com/sex/" target=_new></A>, you are very imaginative. You will look for a partner who is willing to satisfy your relentless pursuit of intense sexual experiences. You fall in love quickly but you are also hesitant to commit completely to anyone.</DIV><BR><BR><H><BR><BR><B>"Time is against us" - Daniel Tirol</B><BR>it seems to be that way.&nbsp; terri schiavo died.&nbsp; the pope died.. 2 ppl in the class of 2006 died recently.&nbsp; and what does time make of it?&nbsp; -&nbsp; nothing.&nbsp; everything is irrelevant to time.&nbsp; it's true, that the only things that are inevitable are death and taxes.&nbsp; it seems like people look for challenges that haven't been challenged yet.&nbsp; and since no one here clearly understands the concepts of quantum physics, what other way is there to take the upperhand on time?&nbsp; <BR><BR>mmm chocolate chip cookies.<BR><BR>problems are just a waste of time.&nbsp; drama and grudges are useless in the process of developing your life.&nbsp; so why utilize them?&nbsp; what good does drama do for us?&nbsp; other than nourish our redundant abilities to argue and exercise forensics, grudges are just a waste of time.&nbsp; someone wise once told me that an unusual thing about me is that when it comes to things like these (drama, elementary hair pulling and petty grudges) i seem to somehow be able to not care.&nbsp; is that true?&nbsp; is it best that way?<BR><BR>if you have a problem and can't seem to fix it i'll gladly fix it for you.&nbsp; if you want a cup of sugar to make a cake then come on over, you silly ass.<BR><BR>is it being too straightforward?&nbsp; cold-hearted?&nbsp; am i really becoming what i've always been afraid of turning into?&nbsp; an insensitive freak with short hair one month and a hedgehog on my scalp the next?<BR><BR>no..&nbsp; i'm not going to change for society, that's just not me.&nbsp; i know people see me as out of the ordinary.&nbsp; but pity was never on my christmas list.&nbsp; either i'm too stubborn or my fear of ambition is slowly subsiding.&nbsp; <BR><BR>you put the lime in the coke you nut.<BR><BR><B>"cmon old man, show 'em you're still worth a damn.... aim carefully... look the devil in the eye.." - Hartigan, <I>SinCity</I></B></H>]]>

<![CDATA[<B>c`mon, dawg..</B><BR>&nbsp; i'm sayin what i'm sayin...&nbsp; if you hear me say i'm turnin left, i'm sayin cuz i'm turning left, not cuz i'm turning right!&nbsp; why do people have to misconstrue a situation that's just given straight forward?&nbsp; now "if a situation is tainted, love is always free", but here i'm not painted glass, i'm speaking from the only thing that controls my motives, and i'm not talkin about the one that's in the middle of my lap.&nbsp; grudges shouldn't be held, cuz if one opinion is structured, then it's the opinion.&nbsp; one opinion should definitely not determine how someone acts towards another person, because the way someone acts towards one person is totally dependant on the person who is acted upon.&nbsp; it makes sense - people get what they deserve.&nbsp; to one point or another.&nbsp; "they deserve each other".&nbsp; they as in not i, therefore i say fuck it.&nbsp; i'm very straightforward, if you know me well, you know that well, as well.&nbsp; unless i'm just crackin on ya ;) then i'm very straightforward.&nbsp; if you got a problem with me and you fail to communicate, i establish a landline.&nbsp; if you need help, my ears are wide open for you.&nbsp; if you get at me, i get right back atcha.&nbsp; <BR><BR><B>"they deserve each other"...</B>&nbsp; oh yes they do.&nbsp; it's like.&nbsp; you're goin down a road.&nbsp; and you come to a fork where the road splits.&nbsp; one way is a road filled with.&nbsp; let's say sex.&nbsp; (why not, eh? eheh) and the other road is filled with (hm.&nbsp; sex and what.&nbsp; ) candy.&nbsp; one road leads to sex, the other to candy.&nbsp; at the end of both roads is your destintation but which way do you go?&nbsp; i say go straight through the woods.&nbsp; if i'm horny, make a slight turn to the left, and voila, sex.&nbsp; if i'm hungry, a little to the right and voila.&nbsp; candy.&nbsp; but keeping straight keeps you straight.&nbsp; i'm deciding.&nbsp; it's down to school and family for me now.&nbsp; <BR><BR><B>[ i will hunt you down and whoomp you</B>&nbsp; whoever you are.&nbsp; if i find you, believe in me i will fucking rip each of your fingers off one by one and stick them up your ass until you regurgetate fingernails.&nbsp; ]&nbsp; i guess i should thank you as well tho, because now, i'm down to my raw self.&nbsp; i have nothing - i have been humbled.&nbsp; thanks for being a scumbag, you mother fucking idiot.&nbsp; but i guess since my roads have been simplified into one freeway, and i'm already speeding.&nbsp; i'm gettin this, i don't give a shit what you think.&nbsp; this is mine for the taking.&nbsp; before you know it, i'll be back in the driver's seat, baby.&nbsp; i don't care if you fuck with me cuz i frankly..<BR><BR>i... i don't care.]]>

<![CDATA[<BR>why am i awake at 3 something in the morning? mixing shit like what's playing on this site right now of course, what kind of question was that. yeh.. i feel like a heart tumor has been scraped off to the size of a wart. why am i tired but not even sleepy at all. i'm fckin freezing. it's funny cuz all of that doesn't matter.. yehknow...<BR><BR><B>i almost died a few days ago...</B><BR>and it isn't until now that i realize how mother fcking grateful i am that those seconds away from death i was kept away from me.. k, i'm goin down this one street right, look left, look right like your typical road master... nothing coming except for a couple cars a long way down the road.. so i go.. out of fcking nowhere this brown car comes skidding down towards me on driver side... 'WTF' i'm thinking 'this bitch better stop'... but yeh it doesn't.. naturally.. i freeze like a deer in the headlights... i guess it was better i didn't try n speed away to avoid it or else the girl in the car coming right for me would'nt have stopped the way she did.. the car literally skipped down towards me cuz she slammed her brakes so fckin hard she had to have been going 40-50 or something like that, dumb hoe.. this was in the middle of a downtown raritan neighborhood, mind you, not the 287.. i'm fuckin lookin like a douche just sitting there with my shades on watching this car come towards me and it stops.. o damn does it stop.. license plate only a foot away from my door handle, i'm talkin, this girl is so close i can see the color of the pupils in her eyes. she just blinked. i think we both knew someone, most likely me, could've gotten at the very least seriously hurt - her car was aimed at my body almost perfectly. the intricate design of this.. escape from death was so impressively executed by fate that. i do believe as my friend did say that 'someone has GOT to be watching over you'.. i do believe it.. i dunno who or what or even why but i do. shit if that car had braked only a second later than it did, my ass would be in a wheelchair or sumin. i for one was scared shitless almost.. i drove the rest of the way to work after that with my right arm shaking and my neck tighter than a rubber band stretched 2 feet long... o holy shit was i scared.. i have never been that scared ever in my entire life.. i drove thinking to myself "dammit. just now, you could have died. just now. in that split second. the money you make tonight would not have matter because you could have died.." i don't care what physics say about the inertia or energy or whatever of the car and its relationship to my sorry ass in the middle of the street, i think i truly, almost died. i escaped certain injury, that's for sure - the car - and i swear - was somewhere near a foot - 12 inches - from my door. THAT is scary. fuck the ring 2 or mothman prophecies. hell, i will always remember the first time i almost got in an accident.. cuz it was the same day death came the closest to me...]]>

i fuckin hate it.&nbsp; it's like watching a wonderous colorful bird flying through the sky and saying to yourself, "hm.&nbsp; that's a beautiful wonderous colorful bird flying through the sky".&nbsp; only to find later on something like "o hey, that bird..&nbsp; if you give the bird the finger it will lay eggs filled with love and dozens of hundred dollar bills in your sock drawer behind the polo sports".&nbsp; and you say. damn.&nbsp; if only i had given that bird the middle finger - i <STRONG>just might be happy</STRONG> and rich right now.&nbsp; damn.&nbsp; i hate that kinda shit.&nbsp; cuz it just pisses the fuck out of me.&nbsp; it just pisses me off.</P><FONT face="times new roman" size=3> <P><FONT face="times new roman" size=3>i hate how <STRONG>people are so complex.</STRONG>&nbsp; the human brain can't even comprehend all at once how much the human brain can comprehend, all at once.&nbsp;

you're "<EM>supposd to</EM>"<U> not think about what people will say about you</U>..&nbsp; but hey, you're "<U>supposed to</U>" <STRONG>make sure you don't piss people off</STRONG>.&nbsp; you're "<U>supposed to</U>" <STRONG>make people happy so you can be happy.&nbsp; how do you satisfy the two concepts at the same time if they contradict each other</STRONG>.&nbsp; tell me.&nbsp;&nbsp;i hate how<STRONG><EM> people need to be nurtured so carefully or else the very fabric of society around you unravels into a chaotic medley of panic</EM></STRONG>..&nbsp; i fuckin hate it.&nbsp; i want to be somewhere where i can depend on people definitely without having to worry about what i do because it might affect other people, indirectly.&nbsp; i fuckin hate the complexity of the human brain.&nbsp;

"Strong Northwest winds ...10 to 15 miles an hour early monday morning ... Wind chill values will approach 10 below zero elsewhere [in New Jersey] tonight and early Monday" To assure that this is in more concern to a more broad spectrum of people than just the high school students, 10 degrees below zero is quite an extreme condition no matter who should be facing the 42 degrees below freezing temperature. Even with a 2 hour delay, workers will have to wake up early in the morning to prepare for a school day. Custodians will spend about an average of 120 minutes outside before the school session begins if not shoveling - salting walkways. Teachers and staff who live far from the Bridewater-Raritan School District will wake up as early as usual. But considering the ridiculous road conditions outside, they will still have to venture out onto what I would hope to assume icy roadways in order to reach our town (not to mention, especially our lovely California-style high school). Strong northwest winds 10-15mph... Even if snow is shoveled off of walkways, this storm brought a dry snowfall. That means the snow can be easily blown back onto walkways, parking lots, or any other area that may need access to during the day. Concerning the high school, it takes well around 13 minutes to get from the field house to the 800 building. Should the wind still show significant force by the time students arrive at the high school, many would be endangered to many possibly incidents where a student or faculty member may be vulnerable to illness or injury. Bundling up is indeed our own responsibilities but we cannot control the weather. It all comes down to one simple message. "We're walking in a foot of snow. The roads are impossible. ITS TOO DAMN COLD."<BR><BR></CENTER> <P><LEFT><FONT color=#000000>There, online petition. Stick <I>THAT</I> up your arse.<BR><BR>Bottom line to this blog is. People spend too much time bitching and complaining. Drama for yo mama and all that copacobana; JUST SHUT THE HELL UP! If you're not gonna take action against something you dislike... If you want something done, then take control of it. - <FONT size=2>Duh.</FONT> </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#000000>No half-assing it here.</P> <CENTER></CENTER> <CENTER></CENTER></FONT></FONT>]]>

"<B>Your heart is free; Have the courage to follow it.</B>"<BR>;sigh of relief;. Christmas is almost... <I>Almost</I> here.. It seems like nowadays <U>everyone</U> has fallen in love, to a point where love, in all it's greatness and power... Has just lost it's touch.. To me, love is...<BR><B>Love is just that feeling of being home. That feeling you have when you're with people and you can just sigh, breathe... Because you have nothing to afflict you when you're with love. <BR>• Love protects you from all evils and ghosts and demons and vampires and booger monsters - the way parents comfort their children... <BR>• Love is the sudden outbursts of randomosity you feel comfortably natural with - the way you can be yourself around your best friends.. <BR>• Love is the way the snow falls down pure white, and lands on the ground, still pure white - that assured, comfortable feeling you get when you know you've done something knowing you can depend on the person you've done it for.<BR>•Love is that light at the end of a long winding stanky ass tunnel - the way people happen to find God after a long life of hardships<BR>• Love is like that feeling when you're just laying in front of a fire on a couch with that one someone, just laying there knowing you're home<BR></B>It feels like everyone has someone. Lucky them. This time last year, I was mad, irritated, impatient, jealous... Extremely jealous, and impatient... It was "Oh God, another depressing winter..." ;grin; I can't say i've totally gone 'monk-enlightened' now. But I've finally gotten to that point where I feel like my time here has been purged and I'm just set... Good to go cuz I know where I'm going with my life.. College, money, family, cars, so on and so on... Yeh, I can't say I'm satisfied now, cuz frankly I'm never satisfied with myself. But I can say this... Instead of wishing and hoping to be laying in front of a fireplace with that one someone, I think I'm just fine with maybe one more winter, driving around or talking walks by myself... Just admiring the view I've had for the past few winters<BR><BR> <CENTER><IMG height=263 src="http://www.zoomscope.com/tove/archives/image/februarhimmel1.jpg" width=300></FONT></CENTER><BR><B>Happy December =)</B>

yeah it seems like everyone has their lover. in a way it sucks because it seems like i wont find someone that&nbsp;i'll actually fall in love with. so far i can only feel love from&nbsp;family friends and relatives. when winter comes im fine, with all those family gatherings/parties, christmas lights&amp;decorations, snow, giving/recieving gifts and those christmas shows on abcfamily.. hehee =]

chris, it means soooo much to me that you came back for my cotillion. I know it's hard to lose someone in your family, and honestly, I didn't think you would come back because I know family does come first. I would have understood if you couldn't come back but you still did. thank you for everything. stay strong, you know your friends are always here to hold you up whenever you need it :).

Live in the past, the present, or the future. Or you could look at it as "1. Negative, 2. neutral, 3. positve", "1. Slow, 2. regular, 3. fast", or even "1. Stressed, 2. balanced, 3. carefree". The second you're classified into one of those categories (1, 2, or 3) you have officially subjected yourself to what paranoid psychotics would call "the system".. Otherwise referred to as "The Man" by hippies, or "The Power" by extremist groups. You pick one... No... Your personality groups you to one category. And the category you live in decides your life. You are dependant on your own personality. Not knowing what kind of person you are, or having qualities of all 3 kinds of people shows spontenaity, but makes life so much less organized. Once you know who you are, you have your life down on a planner and everything is black and white from there. ;shrugs; just a thought that came to me while i was walking to 4th period.<BR><BR><FONT size=2>"With power comes responsibility" - Universal Proverb<BR><FONT size=1><B>ALL THESE THINGS TO DO; THERE AREN'T ENOUGH HOURS IN A DAY ANYMORE.</B> <FONT size=2>And it's true. I'm rebelling against my system just by taking the 5 minutes to type this... Upperclassmen Years and College are the most hectic times in life. After education, you can dedicate your life to work. Before the hectic years, it's all about who can keep more lego people in their mouths. How do you know you're in high school? Well uh, i'm not exactly putting "Stuff mouth with lego men" at the top of my priority list, and work.. Just for the pocket change. Nah, i'm definitely not ready to work full-time, neither am I looking forward to it, just yet. Right now, these are the years you assert your time-management skills and responsibilities. It was true what our parents said, and it's a scary thought having to admit they were ultimately right. Isn't it? But at one point or another, it's all gonna come down to having to fend for yourself and being able to stand on your own two feet, regardless whatever conditions you will be put through, like a palm tree in a hurricane.<BR><BR><FONT size=2>"Anything can happen"<FONT size=1><BR><B>YES I KNOW WHERE IM GOING, I JUST DONT KNOW HOW IM GOING TO GET THERE YET.</B> <FONT size=2>Everyone has plans. For theirself... It depends on who you allow in your life and who allows you in theirs. Yes, I want a kid or two. No, I'm not in that "one" serious relationship. I may be in more than one, but i'm not in THAT "one". That's just God's way of telling you, you don't need to waste your time begging and pleading, just work with what you have. Today's gotta come for a&nbsp;tmw eh? Well whatever happens....

<B> <P>"Perhaps you should plug a hole in your bank account before all the money leaks away. At the very least, don't make any extravagant purchases. Once you have organized your finances and tackled your responsibilities, you will feel infinitely more at peace with the world. You receive an unusual social invitation. Don't refuse, as this will most likely turn out to be a fascinating event. Singletons may well find true love at this time. For those who are partnered, your relationship will receive a breath of fresh air in an unexpected manner."&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; Hah.&nbsp; What a coincidence.&nbsp; I got my pay today.&nbsp; yaYA eheh...</P> <P><FONT color=#0e0000>"if through our travels we get seperated, never forget / in order to survive you gotta learn to live wit regrets" .....</P></FONT><B> <P>Well it can't be talkin about money.&nbsp; Cuz you don't complain bout the money you spend...&nbsp; I'll sleep this one out.</P></B></B>

<B> <P>i could be drunk; i could be sober...&nbsp; i could be crying; i could be cheesin my ass off.&nbsp; but quite frankly, it's not that i don't care - i just don't think it's right.&nbsp; there are some times in my life when i doubt myself.&nbsp; but i do that too much.&nbsp; that's how i got all those bad grades, that's how i mess up at work, and that's how i mess up now with all other miscellaneous shit that goes on.&nbsp; ::so when you don't like what you don't see, don't front cuz i ain't frontin', i'm real, i'm&nbsp;just ME:: at least i can be real and do what i needa do. stop wastin your time and do what YOU need to get done.&nbsp; so while ya'll read this you say "damn chris you needa chill out a little" to yourself and everyone but the person it's directed to.&nbsp; yeh.&nbsp; cuz see that's where everyone's gone all wrong.&nbsp; can't even be real anymore. gotta be all assuming about things -&nbsp;either get shit out, or shut up, and don't worry bout what other people did about it, cuz you're the ones that are still complaining.</P> <P>&nbsp;it's funny because - last year at this same exact time of the season, i was feeling the same exact way.&nbsp; in a way, disappointed but at the same time knowing that everything that happened was inevitable.&nbsp; why.&nbsp; WHY does it keep happening.&nbsp; all the things that circulate throughout their orbit seem to have no intention on stopping.&nbsp; no.. wait..&nbsp; because see, now i'm laughing at myself.&nbsp; myself along with all the people who wonder the same questions.&nbsp; it's obvious.&nbsp; IT JUST DOESNT MATTER.</P> <P>hey here's something cool.&nbsp; my horoscope for yesterday, courtesy of Yahoo.</P> <P><STRONG>Quickie:<BR></STRONG>You don't have to understand why this is happening. You just need to get through it.<BR><BR><B class=yastshdotxt>Overview:</B><BR>It's not like you're famous for self-control to start with -- but now? Well, at this moment in time, you'll be less willing to try. Needless to say, this is a potentially startling situation, especially for those around you. </P></B>

<B> <P>It's weird.&nbsp; That you want things to go right... And you <EM>can </EM>fix them, but it's like hey.. What's the point?&nbsp; There's a thin red line between just being a bitch and having the decency to being just.. In general, a <EM>nice</EM> person.&nbsp; Have respect, know how to act, be mature.&nbsp; We're all of that age now, it's time to grow up.&nbsp; Business has got to come first now, and don't dare say that it 'doesn't HAVE to'.&nbsp; Unless you wanna get somewhere, you're going to HAVE to, and do it now.&nbsp;</P> <P>Now is the time when we secure our tightened ropes that connect us to those we hold close.&nbsp; It's time we cherished our friends and family and show them the thanks you feel, the gratitude you want to express for them just being there; just show the love.&nbsp; If not, then it's also that time to cut the strings.&nbsp; Now will define your character, Now will determine your paths.&nbsp; Now will show, who survived in this world of toiling and troubles.&nbsp; <STRONG>Now </STRONG>will label you, strong or weak.&nbsp; "We are all animals".&nbsp; Animals all have basic instincts, and that is to survive.&nbsp; Who will survive?&nbsp; Now, will decide.</P> <P>And think about it.... <U>When is "now"?</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now", is ALWAYS Now.</P> <P>Now will be later, and now already was.&nbsp; It's time.</P></B>

Night has passed, darkness succumbs to the overbearing gleam of the sun as <I>twilight</I> approaches.<BR><BR>So many things going on right now... But then when I really think about it, it's of nothing to compare with others. In hopes to decipher the thin red line between my goals and my obstacles, I bend time to benefit my needs. Yet as the normalcy is bent, and the stress is gone, it is still only temporary like the lonliness of midnight. A day of chaos is nowhere equivalent to ei8ht hours of silence. Rest will seem to have been done in vain when the sun comes back up and everything is reborn into place. Each step you take further away from your problems, is not only one step closer to another one - but one step away from something you have yet to finish. Like the gallant warrior that battles through the field - he leaves no neck unsevered, no limb overlooked.

<B> <CENTER><IMG src="http://home.comcast.net/~oceanwatch/images/Sunrise.jpg"></CENTER><BR>sometimes the most uninteresting things can hold the greatest weight in value.<BR><BR>it's like:<BR>playing level 70 on tetris, where the pieces come down super fast<BR>walking with boulders tied to your ankles<BR>not being able to sneeze right when you feel it coming<BR>running out of battery for your camera right when _____ walks by<BR>having to push your car that last 2 miles before you get home<BR>dropping all 52 cards after picking them up all over again<BR>stretcthing silly putty in tens of different directions<BR>waking up early to only find out that you're still awake at 10AM on a saturday<BR>eating a whole box of oreos only to find that there's no more milk left<BR>growing up to want to play basketball but ending up one foot shorter than you wanted to be<BR>playing russian roulette with a loaded gun<BR>sneaking out on a night when everyone else is asleep<BR><BR>it takes alot of guts to do the optional things we do. the point where leisure becomes labor is a point where no one should ever have to go. past that point is nothing but lonliness and no looking back. atonement is ever-sought, and the rise of your life means nothing when you drop back to 0. faith and strength together are questioned, while the good will of people is infinitely skepticized. there is no fabric softener in this dryer of lonliness, only hard jagged rocks from the playground, to toughen up the jeans. after each morning, the pieces build upon pieces and the distance from the surface grows greater and greater with each hole you dig.<BR><BR>so shoot me now.<BR><BR>P.S.:<BR>Look at the August 30 entry.

<center></center> <p style="text-align: left;"><span>The Boxer Rebellion.&nbsp; The warriors would dig their hands into barrels of sand the way dogs paddle through water.&nbsp; After a day they would empty the barrel of sand and then put rocks into it.&nbsp; After the second day of rocks, the barrel would be filled with steel bearings.. and after the bearings, searing hot coal.</span></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><span>The point of this practice was not to only&nbsp;toughen the hands of the rebels, but to hone their skills and will power.</span></p> <p style="text-align: left;">So you could say, they were jaded.&nbsp; With one purpose only, with one thing on their mind, they'd live their lives with practice and turmoil but for the purpose of their rebellion.&nbsp; No time for emotion, the rebellion had raised them to not know the word.&nbsp; No space for wasting time, for their trainings had diminished that concept.&nbsp; Business before pleasure was merely an understatement.&nbsp; By sickening fate, love would never cross their paths, all they had was war.&nbsp; Training, will power, determination.&nbsp; <em>Lonliness accompanied them to&nbsp;battle.&nbsp; Independance would reign in their souls.&nbsp; Without the&nbsp;concept of romance, all they had was one thing to live for - and they trained their whole lives to figure out what it was.</em></p> <center></center>

Currently Listening To: "Get Ready"<BR><BR> <CENTER><IMG src="http://img85.exs.cx/img85/6884/bros2.gif"><BR><A href="http://www.xanga.com/illehchillehpnoi" target=_new>brother1</A> and <A href="http://www.xanga.com/styll_tyroll" target=_new>brother2</A> <CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER> <CENTER><BR><B>To Be A Good Person.<BR><BR></CENTER></B>I think nowadays people don't consider the raw characteristics that make us who we are. In simpler terms, materialism has taken the best of the best of us. I guess that's what draws the thin red line between the shallow and the opposite of that, the wanting to become a better person in order to benefit the common people.. So how to become a better person then. Frankly, I believe that there is no orthodox way to become a better person. The only way to become a better person is, to just do it... To become a better person. To want to help others, to want to be an addition to society, to want to leave your name written in stone - maybe not in the books of history, but possibly the books of the lives of your fellow man. <BR><BR>It takes a long time to reflect upon the many things in life that can affect the way you end up. "It's not how much money you make, it's how you make it." is very true. Then again, "It's not how you make your money, it's how much you make." has it's own ups as well. Point is, there is no way to do things, except to always seek the higher standard... Never be satisfied, never be finished. That's the best way to live your life in my opinion, because in the end, you can look back and say to yourself that you in fact, led a passionate life. A life filled with triumphs and tribulations, many along the way. And that no one like you could have possibly went through the kind of things that you went through. And your life would have been the kind of life that everyone else would die for - the best kind of thing a materialistic should want to have.</CENTER>

that's true. i must confess that i do yearn for things. but then again, i always think "man i should be greatfull for the stuff i have now and take advantage of them. think about them kids that don' have what i have." it's crazy how some people NEED to buy every shoe out there. and how people gain <EM>their</EM> confidence in material things. and depend on material things to make them be noticed. i do that sometimes to. it's tho right? i mean it like happens to everyone i suppose. hot blog dude. hot bloooog.

<P>so yeh, i'm a little late with this one =P.&nbsp; work really interferes with the life you sought to have before hand..&nbsp; is this really a part of the preperation for 'real world'?&nbsp; yes, it must be, because i'm beginning to loose sight of the things that held me down pre-initialization..&nbsp; now it's all business to me, with&nbsp;the of course, necessary stripes&nbsp;of family on the business suit..&nbsp; </P> <P>i remember a few years ago, daddy (what we called my lolo on my mom's side) helped fix my door&nbsp;which was locked from the inside..&nbsp; it seemed like he accomplished what was such a complicated task in a few seconds..&nbsp; i'd never had to deal with that same problem until last night...&nbsp; yeh, it was easy.. it only took a few seconds.. but once i pushed the door open a smile subconsciously glazed my face..&nbsp; i felt a presence of .. it was like what it felt like when you were just a child, your first time walking.. all on your own and you fall and begin to cry.. but then there's just that one person who loves you so much who comforts you as to bring you back up on your own two feet again.</P> <P>i smiled.</P>

<P>hey cuz, i was hoping you'd have forgotten where my page was by now, haha... but thanks for the comment in my gbook anyway. i've been going through some rough issues lately... and i have this tendency to get really abstract and pseudo-poetic when i'm in my angst moods. kinda dry to think that people are actually reading it, but hey... i am who i am, no point in hiding it eh?</P> <P>nice layout btw, although the angry red's starting to hurt my eyes... and do i spot trigun? =)p i've fallen out of anime in the past year actually, but that's one of the better series. my current thing is japanese music actually, hence my band... *cough cough* which has kept me preoccupied, and why i don't update anything on my site but my little rant section anymore.</P> <P>insight comes from experience man... the longer you live, the more you have to bitch about. i know that dawning feeling of responsibility... just wait till you're on the verge of turning 21 and see how much worse it gets. inevitable.</P> <P>ah damn, i feel so old.</P> <P>neway, sorry i didn't really talk to you much when you guys came up to visit... i was dead tired when i saw you guys at the mall, and i was at a show with my band over the weekend... hope you guys had a good trip though. it helps sometimes to get away for a while to clear your head. i think i'm in desperate need of travelling too...</P> <P>but yeah. stay strong and take whatever life gives you... it's not all bad. just a learning experience.</P> <P>cya</P> <P>~ jen (in case you forgot my online name)</P>

very interesting blog cuz ~ i guess it's that time of your life where you question yourself "what's your purpose of living?" we all have that phase ~ some found the answers ~ and you will too ~ just believe in faith because that's all you really need to do ~ others tried to seek the answers but with no luck so they jus kept with this fake face that seems like theyre okay, but deep down inside, theyre not ~ i'm happy that i found an awesome joy and truth in life ~ i hope you do too ~ take cares and God Bless you ~ good luck with the driving and all that ~ my cuz is all grown up and im proud of yah ~ *smiles ks~

"oh yeh i could watch tv right now, but i got so much homework to do..." what was it back then? "shit i gotta watch tv right now.. i'll do my homework <B>later</B>" . .. so now there is no later.. <B>"Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday."</B>. That all becomes virtue.. <B>"Change what you cannot accept. Accept what you cannot change."</B> .. that becomes a virtue too... so people dont change, they just make new decisions.. They can't change because those decisions make them who they are.. Maybe you can find out something new about someone but.. they'll always have been the same person you knew with the same beliefs and ideas just a while ago. its all a matter of keeping those eyes wide open, ready for something to jump you in the face. all you can do is take hold of it and do your best.. right?</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

ALOT. math, science, history, english. whatever, you name it, this man is a genius), so all we did was go over vocab. [i've come to the conclusion that i'm somewhat antedelluvian. that means...... - dictionary for you, my friend bwahaha].. then we chilled the last 20 minutes.. we talked about how year after year the underclassmen seem to get more and more immature.... his advice - "you know you've reached maturity when you can accept "change what you cannot accept, accept what you cannot change". That was some deep shit.. lol the way he said it tho, yeh know how it is.. didn't really get to me that much but it stuck.<BR><BR>basketball can teach you alot about life... later that day went to milltown at 3 wit flores n melvin.. played 6 hours hardcore, n well.. if you put the concepts of basketball next to the concepts of life.. they won't look that much different. yes i know what you dirty pervs are most likely thinking too - yes, that DOES apply also..... biologically at least =P<BR><BR><FONT size=3><B>THE ACHING. ]]<BR><BR></B><FONT size=2></B>crazy. woke up, ate ALOT, cut grass, ate ALOT MORE, went to milltown, chugged water, ate AGAIN, played at mercer. mad off that day buh sall g. jammed a thumb in the mix, buh sall g. went home late buh sall g - i had more food at the end of the day hahah yehh.<BR><BR>talkin to some people that day.. n i realized that i'm tired of these sexist people who stereotype guys and girls just because of bad experiences they've had - fuck you. <BR><BR>lets see - the guys. aight, we're a testosterone enraged people but cmon. the women are the ones havin your seed, even if it is by accident. if not respect them, at least respect your own kid and take care of that lil one - you're the one who put half into the baby anyway... seriously man, i think that's fucked up how guys will go around and fuck around wit girls who'd be vulnerable as hell and then not even take care of their asses.. at least show some respect for them too, don't go around sayin oo girls suck.. wtf yo - cooties died out at the age of 7. i mean, yeh we're guys.. but that shouldn't be a derrogatory term.. step up, buddies.<BR><BR>now the girls.. the WOMEN.. i think that it is FUCKED UP how some guys will hold you up when you're down n all.. you can be lookin down one day and a guy would be happy to bring you up.. if not some random guy, at least a close bro.. you girls know what i mean... buh when we're down, we go through massive depression, getting advice from our dawgs which doesn't help as much as it should because it's always the same point of view - and the girls flock together like whoa. so what, it's guys help girls and girls help girls???<BR><BR>"GUYS ARE SOOO GAY" that's bullshit. if we were on the titanic, who gets to leave and who gets to stay and sink with the ship? if we were in a burning building who gets to jump out and who has to stay to make sure everyone else isn't burned and gets out safely? who pays the bill at restaurants, who stands up for you when perves come your way, who sings you love songs when you're feeling like shit? uh. yeh. girls don't want the rights that guys do, they just want the good stuff! like hmm.. i'll take the higher pay, the built bodies, and "hmm i'll take the money too. you can have nasal hair, unibrows and... eh.. i guess you can keep the condoms now that we're equal we won't be needing you right." uh fuck that. this isn't a legal system, this is life. i think that if anyone whether it be male or female pays you respect and just keeps the fag within them from attacking on you, you should at least give them the respect of .. giving them respect. people these days man.. people these days... i'll be back later i got hair to cut.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></B></FONT></FONT></FONT>

You could go through your whole life until the age of 65 with only one kidney - and not knowing it. It's funny though, your life starts out: They check for everything including your kidneys.. And after that you life a regular normal life.. And then before you die, suddenly the kidney issue is an issue again (because you find out that out of nowhere you only have one...)..&nbsp; How the first becomes the last, and makes itself important all over again&nbsp;in the reaches slightly further than your own grasp....&nbsp;It's possible - to be born with one kidney..

<FONT color=#ffffff size=2 background-color="#000000"><B>Happy Mother's Day ::<BR><BR></B>I went to church today, the priest had a bland sermon yet it made me think about much.....<BR><BR>I've always been afraid of what would happen when my mom suddenly passes away. Not like i'm waiting impatiently for it but there comes a time when ppl get there. My mom's a pretty un-young mom [although she hides it very damn well] and occasionally I'd fear for her.. I've even had a dream or two about the actual event taking place. Yes... <I>I'm a MAMA'S BOY.</I><BR><BR>I can't help it though.. She is in fact the one who taught me the practical lessons in life. "Look both ways before you cross the road - or else a truck might come and take your feet away from you.." .. Right. Or, "Don't leave the electricity on in your room when you leave, the house might catch on fire..." .. Yeh. Then again, she did give me this.. "Daddy [what we called my lolo] taught me never to run away from my problems. So I'm telling you now, never run away from your problems because they'll always follow you wherever you go.. So yeah, face them head on and don't run away" .. . <B>Interesting how it was my mother who taught me to be a man....</B> I especially get annoyed whenever I hear this one because I hear it so often lately - "Never take in the bad. Always remember to take in the good from things and reject the bad." Now what is she trying to say.... <BR><BR>Guessing that she trusts my judgement, growing up like that is kinda vague. Not having a specific direction to go, knowing only what you see and imagining what you can't seems generic; it's a hard place to be. That's tough love for ya tho.. The best kind there is.. Honestly, I feel kinda empathetic for those whose parents are so strict. Thinking that their parents want what's best for them, but in my opinion they just want their kids to be like them.. Tough love man, it's a very coarse topic... If it were a course in high school it'd be only for serious AP/honors students strictly geared towards psychology and philosophy.. Serious man, having parents like that is crazy.. [philippines, where ya at . !!] Mind games, guilt, mental torture.. Even if they don't know their doing it, I'd say they're all doing a great job at parenting. <BR><BR>I even feel worse for the people who look down at our mothers for being so trusting and trustworthy in the eyes of their children. What is better, to have a bond, happiness, and success... Or to be choked by a bond, blunt anxiety, and success.. It's like picking a job you wouldn't wanna do. \\stopped typing\\<BR><BR>Hm.. mad respect to the mothers out there.. Especially the women who aren't only mothers, but the women who try to <B>be</B> mothers. <B>And remember, grandmothers are mothers too!</B> My lola called me guapo today ;cheese; hah o man I love my family..<BR></FONT>

it's comin back now..<BR><BR><BR><FONT face=arial color=#555555><B>moral of the day:</B> bickering and emotion is all nonsense, when you're getting business done. business before pleasure, don't get stuck up bout what you want, do what you gotta do first. it's just like what our p`rentz have been teaching us since day one. we dont wanna eat the veggies cuz they taste hella bad but we would've never known that unless they took care of us and made us 'eat our vegetables' long enough to keep us alive until the day we realize that. and what's with the being all inconsiderate: a team is a singular object.&nbsp; one portion of the team must conincide with the other at all times - or else it isn't a team.&nbsp; like a crew, the people in it are family, what happens to one happens to all.&nbsp; unlike, just a bunch of people who stand next to each other.&nbsp; so if you expect something back, remember what the other person's thinking.&nbsp; so what's that? <I>don't be ignorant</I></FONT>

<P><FONT face=arial color=#333333 size=3><B>READ THIS...</B> <FONT size=1>Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give alms, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=arial color=#333333 size=1><B>Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. </FONT></P></B> <P><FONT face=arial color=#333333 size=1>But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=arial color=#333333 size=1>And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; <I><B>for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. </I></FONT></P> <P><FONT face=arial color=#333333 size=1>Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=arial color=#333333 size=1>But when you pray, <B>go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; <I>and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</I></B> And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=arial color=#333333 size=1>Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors; And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=arial color=#333333 size=1><B><I>And when you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men.</I><BR><BR>Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</B><BR><BR><I>But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward <B>you.</I></B></FONT> <B><I>Matthew 6:1-18</I></B><BR><BR></B></B><B>SO BASICALLY...</B> And this is all true. What this is saying is that <B>LENT</B> is <I>not</I> about feeling miserable. <B>LENT</B> is about realizing you have better things to do that sit in front of the computer all day.. Or lay on your bed while you could be out doing something productive. This is saying <B>BE YOU!</B> <B><I>WHO GIVES FOUR AND A HALF SHITS WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF YOU!!!</B></I> Tu es tres stupide, you halfwit, you.. All you who do it for the glory of being under the spotlight. Talking just for the sake of talking, not for the sake of something worth being said. Ok, yes we're all allowed to have fun... But there are always lines - thin thin lines - that can be drawn right where we can't see them. <B>The Gospel is saying..</B> i think.. That people shouldn't be worried about what goes around, around them too much. Because people do.. For example "o Lent.. i'm giving so much up and it's gonna be hell".. That's not the point of Lent is it??

Very ironic since I gave up on social studies when i decided i didn't wanna major in psychology [Psychology requires high marks in social studies and lit]. But yeh, then we talked about the civil war today.. The reason the south had more reason to fight the American Civil War was merely the desire for them to&nbsp;defeat the north was so great. The sense of independance, greatness, and acheivement all overcame the south - which is why they wanted to fight the north all the more.

Which is why nowadays all we have are hoes and playas, because those people are all afraid to commit, afraid to risk getting hurt in the midst of happiness and love.. Faith, is all I have to say.. Faith.. I take a step towards you, don't follow the cycle... Take two steps towards me instead. Because if not.. We're all just giving ourselves hell over and over again.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></DIV></FONT></FONT></B></B>

At almost 3:30 in the morning, I've almost forgotten what it was like to stay up all night and pass the sleepers by. While everyone's having dreams about what their hearts are telling them, the people awake are watching the world continue to spin knowing no matter what you do in life, the world will still spin. Whether you live, die, fail, or fail to survive - the world will just keep spinning. So what do you do? Do you stop the pointlessness right away and jump off your roof? That would seem practical. Then again, why put us here, where purpose seems unevident? To make sure the world keeps turning - that's why we're all here. Trees die, animals die, people die, and the world will eventually die but the world needs us for it to survive. As it it were a parasitic being feeding on the life force that it provides for. So what. Do we give up now, where we can save our own time? Or do we take the unselfish route and pave the way for the continuence of our species? Die now and save our own time - Stay alive and allow the future to perhaps discover the real reason we are all put here. The purpose of life is to keep our human race alive. [No, sex then suicide is not the answer =P] In one way or another everyone benefits the world. Everyone contributes to the human race. Whether it be the communication of knowledge and ideas, or simply opening a door for the elderly. The positive gestures not only cancel out the negative but the kindness in the world accumulates, builds up, and eventually creates a new door for the future. <B>Sadness causes people to stop. Happiness causes people to want to move on.</B> It's a very proven theory, therefore if one person took 5 minutes to say something nice to someone different every day, maybe we would all find the real reason we were all put on this big piece of earth.<BR><BR><B>LOVE..</B> What the fcuk is going on around here. Do i / Do i not. Should i / Should i not. Could i / Could i not. Again I will quote my cousin.. "Don't think about it so much.. That's where all the problems start.. In the thinking process." And it's true!! Teachers tell you that 90% of the time when you're taking a test, your first answer is right.. Only 10% of the time, when you decide on changing your answer, was it wrong the first time. Just do the damn thing.. Just do you. Of course, be considerate to others because others are who we depend on. But still, there has to be a line somewhere between keeping it real and .. just not. If you think a girl likes you, cmon bro don't stutter about it. If you think a like a girl - you most likely do, or else you wouldn't be thinking about liking her right? So do your thing cuz i mean if you take your time to think about it.. You'll end up always being just a day too late. Trust me.<BR><BR><B>LIFE..</B>Mine - moving very fast yet I can't even feel the Earth turning beneath my feet. It's like this.. I have all this shit to do but I don't feel like any time is passing at all. In one word - procrastination. Missed my first mid-term cause of this crazy ass dream I had. [I SWORE I was awake. . The dream was so damn real..].. And what did I do about it? I had my hair colored red. By this professional down the block with the aid of her assistants.. I look like frikkin.. Sisqo from Dru Hill.. [yes, that thong.. thong thong, thong thong.. song..] And I hope my hair doesn't fall out in 2 weeks because I added 'artificial substances' to my hair.. It'll look good by the time i fix it up =).. Also considering finally getting a job but i don't think i'm quite ready for that yet.. Once I get better grades than I've been getting, then I'll reconsider. And........... It's getting early I should go to bed.<BR><BR><B>TIME AFTER TIME..</B> Eh.. I'll re-layout by early Feb... Before my birthday. Ahem. Ahem ahem.. [cough february eleven cough cough] Lol I don't really care about my bday actually.. Just seems like another fading holiday. Till next time you poosers, payce.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></DIV></FONT></FONT>

And that you're knowledgable of the fact that <I>the only thing that is inevitable is inevitability and death..</I> Once you grasp and accept that fact, you can do anything in life. Anything. Death is the taboo subject these days, parallel to what 'sex' was back a few decades ago. When someone hears about death they think goth, outcast, psycho. Those people - just have a long way to go before they can outstretch their lives to their limits.. Full potentials.. <B>What are you made of?</B> What is everyone made of?<BR><BR><B>THAT CHARADE YOU PUT UP..</B> When you feel you're alive. Is a totally different concept than <I>trying</I> to feel alive. Adaptation has it's thin red lines. When you adapt to follow what everyone else accepts, that's not adapting to life. That's submitting to everyone else. I'm gonna pinpoint people from my area.. Especially those cliché cheerleaders and jocks who people would automatically assume to be unbelievably stupid. If not stupid, a total jackass/asshole/asswipe/asskisser. <B>What kinda person are they trying to be when they say it's <I>cool</I> to be stupid?</B>.. If not them, especially those people who are in reality smarter than the average shmoe, but when it comes to having a conversation with you, they're just the kind of person who would embarress you at a fancy restaurant. Rude, obnoxious yet a socially accepted figure.. How does that work? .. .. <B>PEOPLE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT!!!</B> Those people that go on and on about how life is so important.. How the people in it matter to you so much.. But on the other end of the stick, they turn around and live life only for the feeling of attention, the thrill of having a one-session friend. What they mean to them is what a millionaire means to a prostitute. What about those who truly cherish the person who spends their small 10 minutes with them - they get no credit when it comes to the bottom of it all? Why try to make the world a better place when you can't even make yourself the better person?<BR><BR><B>WHATEVER..</B> We're all dead, accept it.&nbsp; I know I still have that to do, but it really is something to think about. &nbsp;Now all that matters is not what, but how we live our life in the time that is given to us. You can spend your time running away from the endpoint in time, or live off of the adrenaline rush and run towards it. <B>Because that's all that matters in life, and what will matter in the end..</B> Not what you've done, but how you did it.<BR><BR><B>ONE MORE THING, FOUND THIS OFF OF SOME XANGA..</B> "NICE GUYS FINISH LAST"<BR><BR><B>It’s amazing that assholes can get girls.</B> Actually, now that I think of it, it’s not that amazing. They are assholes at heart, but to meet girls they lavish their undying love. <B>IT’S A CHARADE.</B> They act nice, friendly, and they listen… until they get into what they’re after. Their prey thinks they are in love with them, however when they realize what assholes their predators really are, they pretend like the asshole is really nice inside. The girl tries to change the asshole into a nice guy, but assholes will always be assholes. <I>She gets upset and goes to the nice guy to complain about the asshole. But she claims to love the asshole…</I> now this is where the theory begins. She doesn’t want to look like she is easy so she wont dump the asshole right away, instead she will stay with the asshole. Girls are idiots. <B>They don’t realize that the nice guy has been there all along. <I>He never had to pretend to be a good guy to get girls because he is naturally like that.</I></B> However, girls don’t see it for some reason or another. They look at the nice guy as a friend, a trusted companion to whom they can tell their sad story to about their asshole boyfriend. But the nice guy isn’t THAT naïve. He was trying to score with the girl he listens to all along. <B>The problem is that since he is a nice guy he keeps listening.</B> Since girls get attached to things that pay attention to them, they think of the nice guy as a friend. A FRIEND. They don’t say, “Oh he’s hot” or “I want to have his children” about the nice guy, they just want the <B>emotional support.</B> When they get the emotional support from the nice guy, they don’t need it from the asshole. The nice guy gets the shit end of the stick while the asshole gets all the action. I am starting to wonder if being a nice guy is really the route to take to get action… I have been down this path for all of my post-pubescent life and it has gotten me NOWHERE… at least not in the women department. Perhaps another reason why girls fall for the asshole is because assholes ignore the girl they are with. The women wonder, “Why isn’t he paying attention to me?” so they explore why. <B>They poke and prod and get closer to the asshole.</B> <FONT color=#ffffff>[lmao i can't believe he wrote that]<FONT color=#000000> They start to get easier with each attempt to get closer. The asshole finally says, “I’ve let this beauty dangle long enough, time to boat this bass”. It is then he puts on his charade and the girl feels like she has won him… even though all she has won is an asshole. Once you have gone down the path as a nice guy or a “listener” you can’t turn back. The girl will always go after the assholes because there are always nice guys there to listen. Once you realize that you are a “listener” you cant do anything about it… just pack up and close shop. There is no way you will get into her pants… ever. There is and never will be a situation where the nice guy will get the girl he has a crush on. It just doesn’t work like that. The girl wont “come to her senses” and realize what an asshole her boyfriend is like in the movies… instead she will just go after another asshole, and unless you stop being a nice guy, she will never go after you. Women complain that there are no nice guys in the world. Right. They are obviously not looking hard enough because there are nice guys EVERYWHERE!!!! <B>Girls aren’t looking for nice guys… they say they are but they’re not. </B>They are looking for the perfect asshole, but there is NO SUCH THING as the perfect asshole. All in all, the nice guy gets the shaft. To all the girls out there with boyfriends that don’t treat you with respect, that don’t listen to you, and that don’t care about you I say this; look next to you. The guy that has been standing next to you the whole time is the guy you have been looking for. He is what you want your asshole to be like. He knows more about you than you know about yourself… because he has listened to it all. <BR><BR>- Garrett Hols <BR><BR><B>TRUE, HOW OH, SO TRUE..</B> Good Night ^_^. Oh. Baby blue's my favorite color, if you couldn't tell. I wonder what you want for Christmas...?</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></DIV></FONT></FONT>

Somethings been taunting me again however...<BR><BR><B>THAT DAMNED FEELING..</B> <S><STRIKETHROUGH>I think it's all beginning to come as obvious to me.. People can be sooo.. Maarte.. Then again.. It's my fault for even trying.. That damned feeling of <B>lonliness you can't quench</B> by yourself but when you ask for help no one is willing.. When you offer to give, they take and run away.. <I>Emptiness.. Forsaken.. Abused..</I> Don't know why tho, I've had this feeling before but only Go.. . who knows, why it's come back again.. You want to care so badly for someone, your friends, your cousins, all have that feeling.. The person next door has that feeling.. You watch your parents loving each other the way you want to love someone else, but that someone else, you don't even know who it is anymore.. That feeling of being so alone, I don't know how to put it to words, I guess I'm just letting myself into paranoia again.. Or mebbe I'm just writing down what my fingers tell me to write.. <I>;sigh; </I>How good it would feel to know that you cared for someone and at the same time knowing they cared for you.. Whoever it may be.. What it'd be like for me to feel that again.. That feeling of surprise when you're in love, but.. I'm finally........... starting to lose the concept.</S></STRIKETHROUGH> To be hugged. That feeling of love. But no, my heart turns cold yet again, until someone can come along to thaw such a huge chunk of ice.. And teach me what it's like to live.. Teach me what it's like to believe in God.&nbsp; Teach me what it's like to have someone to hug..&nbsp; Teach me what it's like to feel I'm alive.<BR><BR><B>I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M WRITING..</B> Just pitiful jibber jabber I threw into this blog.. Finally got new timbs <I>;faint smile; </I>.. Duck Dodgers is a cool show.. Porky Pig is a funny bastard lol.. I need a new layout.. Which anime show should I base it upon this time.. ;sigh;<BR><BR><B>BRO, SIS..</B> People tell me not to let it get to me. But if I said it didn't I would be lying... This is the darkside of me shining because I've lost the concept of why the lightside shone.. O man, lemme stop myself before I get deep in thought..... =P<BR><BR><B>SO NOTHING LEFT TO SAY..</B> O except a lil birthday big to YB, damned 16 year old already.. Get that BMW quick nigga. Should I start counting down to mine? Aw hell why not.. 3 days less of 2 months till my 16th.. Ooo I can feel that permit already ^_^.. Damn.. How life flies by.. It's as if it was only yesterday I was in PWay in our lil 2 room brick development home making cities with my giant legos... ;sigh; Why won't my mom stop talking about how old she is.. Doesn't she know I already feel the same way?<BR><BR><B>WAIT ONE MORE THING..</B> Carlo, aka Carman.. I drove that bitch's car on D4.. 5 mph cuz i was laughing too hard.. Good look buddy, you and your master plan..<BR><BR><B>ARIANE..</B> Your empanada is coming..<BR><BR><B>KILWOO KIM..</B> Ill get you some lyrics soon enough..</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></DIV>

It is all worth it, because you may not know it but the son you are raising has each and every bit of wisdom in his heart that you have instilled in him. Or at least attempted to. Thank you both for loving me the way you do, for the way you push me so, for the way you yell at me, to get me angry and fuel the ambition I have deep down, waiting to explode. You've made me realize finally the most important things in life, treasure friends, appreciate family, and look within deep yourself. Like I said, words cannot express, those were just sidenotes ^_^.<BR><BR><B>AND SO..</B> I bid the online world good night for now, as I shall retire to my bedchambers.

Alright for me, considering I <B>did no homework... at all..</B> This marking period, yeh I'm doing my homework =P Plus my french teacher's calling my rentz on me this time if I do happen to miss one assignment..

So far, for the first week I've gotten everything down pat - everything's all chips n dip.. So that's my marking period, just school, school, school..

Fell asleep at 5:30 last night and woke up at 2 telling myself to go back to sleep but.. =P.. Wanting to get Jay-Z's "Black Album" ooOo soo much.. Grrr it's so damn cold out.. And.. Basically all I have left to say is I'm changing the layout again.. Obviously.. And,.. I need some recommendations on what songs are really good out there right now .. Haven't really heard anything worth hearing on the radio lately, so let's see what the xanga world has to say.. Arighty, it's breakfast, homework, then a new layout for me - Till later, <I>smile a little, payce.</I> </FONT></DIV></TR></TBODY></TABLE> <CENTER></CENTER>

After I've went through revitalization after revitalization - realizing that spending my time going after some intangible feeling of love I had so subtly thought was there, somewhere, in someone so close yet so far from me - I've realized it's all inevitible. She can come and go as my subconscious mind so pleases, but school will always have it's deadline. Not necessarily school. Friends and family as well. Not only that but I've come to realize that [thank you Albert] why rush. It's undeniably unreasonable to look within someone, the epitomy of the opposite of a serious relation, when what I want is undoubtedly somewhere else. Although that means I have to continue searching, searching and searching ever so vigilantly, I think it's worth it. <B><I>"You can't be with the one you love, and love the one you're with."</B></I> I think I'll eventually find someone who I can depend on. Someone mature enough who can actually hold a relationship but someone immature enough where as I can just have fun. After all this stress I've encountered the least i would want is no fun.. All I want is fun. For now. [again, thank you Albert] So for the meantime, Fuck it. I have no intention on falling in love again.

Did you know a farmer loses money when he sells his corn. Did you know that on this world it seems, all the hopes and dreams.. Of blooming kings and queens will fade after the new of other things.. " -Ehchi.]<BR><BR>[.check it.&nbsp;<I>When I Come Around&nbsp;- Green Day<FONT size=1></I><FONT size=2><BR><BR><FONT face=arial color=#d1b217 size=2></B> <HR> <HR> <BR>[. <U><B>Observation of the Day</B></U><BR>. Understanding that growing is one thing. While difficult and very subliminal, actually experiencing obstacles and realizing them in time to evaluate them in the present tense as opposed to thinking about them too late.. That my friends, is a totally, more <B>frustrating</B> thing..<BR><BR>[. <U><B>Where Should I Start..</B></U><BR>. For the sake of preventing connection between my thoughts, I'll start with this.. <B>Down points in life.. come too often when you see them</B>.. But when you're not aware of what negatives you have, <I>down times don't happen enough</I>.. You could be the light of a center of people and not realize that deep down you need some real maintenance work.. Or.. you could be the greatest soul God put on this earth.. but no realize that God made you human as well, and you need some serious social makeovers.. I've lost track of what my point was.. . . . Ah. .raight.. So I'm taking a break from being the grimey socialite i always wanted to be.. <B>School needs it's attention</B>. . Weight room.. ehh.. <B>Jimmy, you're gonna have to lift 10 extra pounds for me dugg hahah</B>.. mebbe not exactly going to be one of my priorities anymore.. <B><I>Basketball will definitely stay top 3</B></I> heheh.. But school work definitely needs more balancing out.. <BR><BR>[. <U><B>Speaking Of Which..</B></U><BR>.</B>It takes a lot of skill to see what parts of your life need balancing out.. <I>I remember talking to my mom a long time ago when she revealed to me that what needed balancing out wasn't me:my social life.. i needed to consider school work as well. Which shocked me very much because i never would've considered balancing life involved school work as well.. I had totally forgotten that..</I> Recently.. yes, i've had my moments of "OOo so you like...." and "Hey Chris look it's your girlfriend!" .. mockingly, obviously.. But nothing's really come from that.. I tried to light a spark with a pen but there wasn't enough ink to go around I guess.. And apparently.. There are other 'spark-writers' on the field lolz.. Being that.. I had time to reflect on shit.. 1: I made my first move <B>but</B> I got no response.. 2: In the back of my head there's a voice screaming "DO YOUR HOMEWORK, CLEAN YOUR ROOM!".. ever so constantly.. and 3: .. Well.. let's just say i'm in no position to accept competition.. Yeh.. I've done the math.. No need for mocking me anymore, regardless how entertaining you think it may be =\.. Stop with the sarcasm already.. But anyway.. I'll just step aside from this tribulation of mine and watch whatever happens from the outside.. <BR><BR>[. <U><B>Now.. Flip The Script.</B></U><BR>. Breathe in.. Lemme change the topic up real quick . . I was in the shower today thinking about random stuff.. yeh know.. basketball.. . Why listerine actually unclogs toilets.. Why when you put a remote control car key to the bottom of your jaw and press unlock from far away, it amazingly unlocks... Yeh know.. that stuff.. Then out of nowhere the song "Where Is The Love" by Black Eyed Peas pops in my head.. and i start singing it a lil yeh know heheh.. <I>And then I started thinking about the real meaning of the song</I>.. <B>Do people really understand the concept of the essence of that song? "Where is the love?"</B>. It talks about wars, hate crimes, violence and so on, so forth.. But I think it goes deeper, <U>beyond</U> that.. Aright.. think about this.. remember the days when you would run around, litttle toddlers, and when you came to a door, someone would most likely hold it open for you? When you couldn't open a jar of cookies, so your friend who came over did it for you.. Or when your rentz' car broke down on the highway and some random person would stop and help?.. What happened to those days... <B>These days.. When people watch you down the street, they aren't lookin to say hi, how are you.. They're worried about you stealing their damned land nome!</B> When a group of kids are sitting on a porch and another group passes by, they don't smile, they glare.. When an elderly is walking to a door, people don't hold the door open for them, they wait for the door to open by the elderly! WHERE IS THE LOVE!?!?! So much independance within individuals, so much self-centeredness and<B> i never see random acts of kindness anymore!</B> No more smiling when old white ladies walk by, only glares and defiant sneers! WHERE IS THE LOVE?!?!? <B><I>Fuck war! War can wait! </B></I>What I'm worried about, honestly, is the common good of everyone in general.. No, I'm not being old school and demanding more old school ethics.. But think about it.. Why is it that you say someone is nice when someone you don't know smiles and says hi to you? So that means everyone else who doesn't is bitchin? I thought about all this in the shower.. My decision.. Expect your door to be held open.<BR><BR>[. <U><B>Enough Non-Physical.</B></U><BR>. And finally, today.. Just an update.. Stayed after for yearbook, did nothing at all.. Asked Chris Wing FIVE times "Why the hell did we join yearbook" lolz.. Hopped the late bus home.. Rested awhile at home, stopped by <A href="http://www.xanga.com/sweetx9xguy" target=_new><B>Melvin.</B></A>'s to 'pick him up' .. sorry.. 'wake him up' and played basketball with <A href="http://www.xanga.com/http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=PnoY_Nikk0" target=_new><B>Nikko.</B></A> at JFK.. And surprisingly.. <A href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=LilMase985" target=_new><B>Albert.</B></A> dropped by.. Whom I haven't seen for a very long time.. And played good basketball.. Hahah funny ass bitch <A href="http://www.xanga.com/sweetx9xguy" target=_new><B>Melvin.</B></A> tryin to 'tap' my ass.. No.. not working dugg.. Not today at least .. Sorry =)<BR><BR>[. <U><B>One Last Thing</B></U><BR>. Thanks for helpin me with my geometry Athena lol =P<BR> <HR> Unless I take another shower and think up something MORE random..

I've come to support that.. It's ironic how when you sustain a flesh wound, it hurts <I>more</I> cleaning it and waiting for it to heal than when you actually receive it.. hmmm .. ;ponders;.. hahah anyway.. <BR><BR>[. <U><B>The Cloudiest Day of the Week.. So Far..</B></U><BR>. What was weird was that I didn't really get a headache yesterday.. When it was all cloudy and the barometer showed an unusual pressure in the air.. And yeh, I get headaches every single time the sun is shut out and winds start blowing.. Not to sound like.. X-Files-ish but I just been feeling this weird vibe lately - Something real is gonna happen soon.. Well mebbe not soon.. <I>persay</I>.. just.. soon enough.. And i'm really trusting my instincts on this one.. Lolz i've been predicting some weird shit lately.. IE: I had a dream a few nights ago that I was covered in bandages and my ma was cotton swabbing all this peroxide on my arm and it hurt like a BITCH.. and yeh know.. that kinda dream where it feels so real - in reality i was sleeping on my arm but hahah.. That same day I got into an uh.. accident and I got o 2 or 3 flesh wounds not that bad as much as to be covered thoroughly with bandages but.. It still hurts =P.. <B>I think everyone has their psychic abilities</B>.. Cuz believe it or not it is true that there are people out there equipped with natural born telekinesis.. Real serious here.. <B>You always have two opposites of a kind</B>. Like the movie <I>Unbreakable</I> if anyone's seen it.. You have the person who is so accident prone every step they make is harmful.. And you have the opposite.. who when pain is attempted upon, just.. Has no concept of pain.. Then yes, of course you have your people in the middle.. Which is just about everyone here.. No superhumans in this town hahah.. But still.. you get my point raight? <B>You never know your true potential until you take the time to get to know it....</B> .. Ergo the old saying, "Patience is a virtue".. Amen..<BR><BR>[. <U><B>TROPICAL STORM... Isabel..</B></U><BR>.</B> Yes, yes, you weatherchannel.com freaks, there's no hurricane.. as of about 9:13PM, the hurricane downgraded to a tropical storm and from Northern VA, the storm is moving North/Northwest.. In the direction of around the southeastern tip of Pennsylvania.. ;shrugs; .. Hell, It's not even raining that hard right now and it's past 4AM.. ;snaps; damn, coulda had a free day today.. O well.. then again if it still WAS a hurricane and if it DID come near Baritan.. Shit would hit the ceilin fan.. Damage in D.C. was reckless.. From what pics I saw.. Throroughness forehl like it was some devil hurricane heheh.. <BR><BR>[. <U><B>So Basically..</B></U><BR>. That's it for this week then, no day off for me.. Ah can't wait till uh.. I dun think i'm allowed to say yet cuz some info might leak out.. But Saturday should be fun.. Considering the uh.. `hurricane` is passing by.. unless she dropped her purse and turns around towards New Jersey to look for it.. Yah, not happening =P.. <B>Hip-Hop-Dance Tryouts</B> . . Good luck girls! Plus Ryan! .. uhh.. hahah quick disclaimer about that.. I went strictly to watch.. yeh know support my buddies tryin out.. And then hopefully play basketball after hahah.. I wasn't even sposed to try out for that thing in the first place.. Then again i don't remember why i actually did.. <I>So basically</I> I left cuz yeh, i'll admit the ratio of girls to guys was quite intimidating.. Intimidating in a good way tho.. yeh know like.. "Aright now bend down and touch your toes.." [ O_O-]-----(<U>--</U>_)(__) hahahaha =P . Never said it was a BAD intimidation, but still.. Yeh know.. lolz it threw me off focus!!! heheh. And plus.. as Jimmy said.. Why be dancing in the middle of a basketball game when we're gonna be IN IT.. Yes, yes AMEN duggy, the Baritan basketball game is about to change up this year.. That's my growing goal this year.. I'm flyin over dudes this season.. You'll see..<BR><BR>[. <U><B>CDC Intro Meeting</B></U><BR>. Wow.. Not quite what I expected.. <B>[1]</B> SO MANY DAMN FRESHMEN!!!!! <B>[2]</B> Uh.. SO MANY DAMN FRESHMEN!!!!.. Yeh there's always gonna be that problem =P More and more people are just having more and more sex <IMG height=15 src="http://www.xanga.com/Images/smiley3.gif" width=15> .. But wow Mr. Scream-much.. So reminded me of Jon last year.. LAST YEAR.. Wow it's gonna be hard going from that one freshman year that impacted me so much cuz there were hella seniors I looked up to cuz yeh, i was that typical freshman.. Last year was&nbsp;when that foundation&nbsp;was built deep down inside me.. I don't wanna sound ignorant to the upperclassmen cuz&nbsp;i know they&nbsp;would know better than I do, really.. But still I think i can relate to SOME extent when I say that this year..&nbsp;Will be totally different.. Not necessarily for the better..&nbsp;Not saying CDC Officers lack authority this year.. Just&nbsp;that to me, the&nbsp;high mark was made last year.. Good luck tho, it should be hard living up to that..&nbsp;Yeh know.. Just that opinion from the typical freshman inside me..&nbsp;&nbsp;But.. nowadays it isn't typical anymore.. In the future you'll have kids who just don't give a shit about anyone else but them. Trying to be rebels but what they don't realize is that if you wanna be a rebel - DONT GO TO SCHOOL.. <B>You have your people tryin to be GHETTO - Wearin RICH ASS WATCHES.. People tryin to be GANGSTA.. With that Private School Look???</B> Again.. Cocky ass kids wanna be rebels thinkin you too good for everyone at school - <U>THEN DONT WASTE BOTH OUR TIMES IN GOING!!</U> It's that simple raiight?? [Ok it's raining again] .. I mean .. c`mon last summer you had `The World`, who after the summer i heard changed their name to something `Soldiers` ? .. Hmm I dun know about that kids, you gotta grow up, you go to High School, you don't [hehahah taken from Speedy, who took it from Jon] "go to School, High" .. [by the way I like that - clever .. hahaha] .. Put aside, I dunno... I still feel like something real's gonna happen.. Not to anyone in specific.. More like .. Just.. everyone.. The storm's still coming people, I'm just speaking metaphorically here..<BR><BR>[. <U><B>One Last Thing</B></U><BR>. Reggae is good =) <BR> <HR> Until the next time I pull an all nighter.. <B>Payce</B> .] <HR> <HR> </B></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></DIV></DIV> <DIV class=blogheader><BR></DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

What issue are you sick of hearing about? ignorance.. unsuccessful puppy love.. <BR><BR>8. What is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to you? eh.. i dunno.. i don't take much to embarressment.. but recently i was biking around with my friend and this dog started wildin out on me barking like crazy..

I went through a few photo albums awhile ago not realizing how bitchy I was to my lil bro.. I'd take sumin and then he'd start crying.. And I felt bad like I can't believe I caused someone to feel like that <B>without my knowing</B>.. So lately I've been chillin with him alot.. Just talkin n shit..

It's just that weird feeling you get when you watch a kid grow up.. <B>That's why I like the concept of friends</B>.. To me.. friends are family.. Friends are the kinda people who you can just say "Wait hold up" to in a fight and "Aright let's go" right quick.. Friends to me.. Put no restrictions to how deep a bond can get.. You could not talk to a friend for a month and once you call them up 4 weeks later it's just like "Hey what's up, yo this girl is hella hot bro!" yada yada yada heheh.. I talked to <B>Joe</B> awhile back about how if two friends <I>like the same person</I> .. Who gives a fuck.. That person should never get in between friends. It should be handled like a freakin bet for God's sake, why should someone get in between a bond that deep.. That's what <B>I</B> think. .]<BR><BR>[. ANYWAY..

You COULD put it that way.. But anyway..<BR><BR>Thinkin bout past shit.. Gettin involved wit people who i wasn't really feelin after meeting the hidden side of that personality.. yall know how it is.. Then comes around and leaves little hints like "i think you're an ego maniac".. Down there in the chatterbox if you're wondering. Not saying I know who it is foreally tho, but the iP address just gives me a hunch.. So, then i got started on thinking. Maybe I'm just not cocky enough huh.. Or I try not to be while on the other hand, shit.. I really don't give a fuck what people think about me, that's cocky enough.. Then again everyone is cocky to some extent, I just feel like expressing that extent more.. I'm tired of bein the nice quiet kid.. Well.. hahah I'll still be the nice kid, just not as quiet, huh? Shit is on man.. Point is, people don't understand things.. What I don't understand is why people hide their feelings.. I used to.. Shit I'm hella tired of that eheh straight up.. "truth never did anyone bad" .. but "reality hurts" -quoted from a convo with <A href="http://www.xanga.com/home/aspx?user=xxpinaybabe" target=_new>[.Ariane.]</A>... I think that as generations pass on, the younger generations get more reliant on the comfortable lie, as opposed to that is, the older generation's raw truth.. Like you know how people used to say <B>"Back in MY day, we didn't HAVE vacuum cleaners! Sus! Ano, we just spit on the floor and wipe it with our foot!"</B> well.. maybe you don't know how people used to say that but.. Just an example =P.. Anyway, yeh we do have vacuum cleaners, or in my point in case, we do have the ability to hide our feelings.. We might as well if we can right? But life would be harder if otherwise.. If we didn't hide our feelings what would happen.. Ignorance is bliss but you aren't aware of what's going on around you, how are you supposed to grow, how are you supposed to learn.. <B>And NO ONE knows the REAL you.. unless YOU tell them.. cuz you can't let other people tell other people who you are, only you can fully do that.. If you let other people do your job of showing yourself to the world for you, you're only showing parts of yourself.. Maybe even letting them show the negative parts and excluding all the positive..</B> You would live an unproductive life if you live an ignorant one so what's the point in living at all if you're not gonna show the world what you're made of? So fuhk it.. World, meet Ehchi, Ehchi, this is the world.] <HR> <HR> </DIV></FONT></FONT></FONT></B></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<DIV style="BORDER-RIGHT: #68a8d8 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #68a8d8 1px solid; FONT-SIZE: 11px; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; OVERFLOW: auto; BORDER-LEFT: #68a8d8 1px solid; WIDTH: 600px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #68a8d8 1px solid; HEIGHT: 250px"><FONT face=impact color=#68a8d8 size=3> <HR> [// <I>begin mindless stark raving madness here...</I><BR><BR>[// <FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=2><B>IM TIRED OF IT. SICK AND TIRED OF IT ALL. </B>I'm giving up on everything "My life is played out like a jerry curl im ready to die" -<I>Notorious BIG</I>.. I'm tired of everything. I'm tired of always just thought of as "THE NICE GUY" and the one everyone relies on - AS A LAST RESORT.. IM DAMN TIRED of being the one people ask favors for and get nothing in return, i'm damn tired of it.. JUST THE SHIT KICKED TO THE CURB that's all i am. Who cares.. Family of course but if they weren't family would they really.. Family is a given bond by God to see if things really do work out and well lookie here <I>they're not</I> No, nothing has purposely sparked this sudden epiphany of a realization but me.. While I was cleaning my pool.. Yes, while i was cleaning my pool.. And while I was scooping bird shit out of chemicalized water, I thought, <I>why am i always the one people shit on</I>. I realized that people don't talk to me, I talk to them.. If i hadn't <U>tried</U> to be the happy go fuckin lucky guy that talks to everyone just to say hi and goodbye maybe i wouldn't have realized all this.. I do a favor, I get shit back.. You rely on me and I expect to rely on you.. even just for a simple conversation but no.. Just the shit kicked to the curb.. And to the <I>innocent</I> people who have no fuckin idea who i am and why i seem so sadistic.. I'm so very sorry ;fake smile; - but you've caught me at a very low time in my life.. I have NO ONE to rely on.. Others who feel this way have at least one person to look up to but where's mine.. They've all come and gone.. I'm sorry if i've failed peoples opinions as the so called "Godfather of Wisdom" i seemed to be before my sudden collapse in personality.. It's just not helping.. I'd rather be a happy jackass than a depressed shit eater who revolves around the people who constantly throw him around. And <I><B><FONT color=#68a8d8>please truly forgive me for ever hurting ANYONE whoever was struck or appalled or whatever any other big Lit ll teacher word i can think of, if i ever hurt anyone while i was being the happy jackass that i wanted to badly to be.. I realize now that i was in no position to do what i did, again, as a jackass.. I just want to make peace with everyone again and have things the way they were before, knowing they can't be like that......</B></I><FONT color=#ffffff> anyway.. .. As if i had anything to begin with in the beginning.. Nothing.. Noone.. and at least everyone out there has ONE DAMN PERSON.. AT LEAST ONE.. wheres my due and proper.. My apologies to the other people reading this and thinking "What the fuck is this kid's problem.." . . well stop being ignorant and feel my pain before you can judge me.. Everyone's had their share of needle pricks but i've had my share of multiple shots at the chest... I've taken shots not necessarily bullets for so many others from issues involving so much drama.. That i could start a depression store in my very own chest... I've taken so many damn metaphorical bullets and i'm only so young.. As if i was given by God to do people's spiritual volunteer work, pick up everyone's shit.. This is fuckin with me now and I don't deserves this.. They say that if you have a bad life, you have to wait it out till the end, and you get what you deserve for enduring such a <I>painful life</I>.. And is that true.. How do you know.. Am I willing to endure all this pain times God knows what number just to acheive something worth one second.. The day before I die will I look back at this tortured life and say "Well, wasn't that worth the wait".. <B>You can rely on the world to be your comfort but when you rely on the people in it you're fucked over</B>.. Who was there for me.. Who is now.. No one bothers to ask anyway so why give a fuck.. And then you might say "o buck up you pussy it's life".. fuck you i know what life is.. I'm living one right now.. I'm not aiming to sulk and confide in this xanga - although this xanga is all i have to confide in.. i'm not looking for sympathy i'm just making my mark on the world.. And then the people who just laugh and say "HA.. Your life sucks.. mine doesn't.." ... Laugh it up.. Although I won't do anything about it, I know the consequences if putting this up.. And i know the consequences of confiding in random people who sometimes end up to be people like that.. And then to the people who feel sorry for me but are too far away to do anything about it.. I don't blame you.. you were my comfort from this forsaken shithole.. I loved getting away from this place then again i hated it because i knew i had to come back here.. And then there are the <B>"real"</B> happy go lucky people.. you.. are damn lucky that you have never felt pain like mine.. you.. are damn lucky that every single day the only thing you look forward to is saying hi to the quickest person you can find.. You're <B>so damn lucky you feel <U>loved</U> 24/7</B> .. No one knew.. no one ever knew.. Until now, when the whole web can see how much pain a world of a life can give one person.. And I don't mind.. I don't mind that people think i'm psychotic.. I don't mind people think i'm sadistic.. All everyone else really knew was that "NICE KID" that people could talk to when they needed some bitch to dump their problems on.. Some shitsack they needed an opinion from when they needed to break bad news to someone they didn't wanna hurt but didn't mind thinking ill off.. Don't think this is about YOU.. Whoever you is.. God bless you for feeling guilty.. . I blame the whole damn world.. Everyone complains and they do nothing of it.. Everyone cries but they do nothing to break a smile.. And it just pisses me off how when someone asks for a hand i stretch mine out.. And when everything's all parcheesy i get pushed down to where i was trying to get someone out of before.. .. And then i realize... I was never this quiet. At least when I was still a toddler everything was care-free.. And then I go through all the old photos of me.. me and my brother.. me and my cousins.. and i realize.. that's what i want.. but the only way to get that hapiness i still need to finish off school and all that shit.. So i don't care .. I don't care anymore if you think i'm psychotic, sadistic, quiet, nice, just that kid.. Which they always do think i am anyway.. I'll always be that psycho down the street or the sadistic freak across town, or the cute nice guy who you checked out browsing through xanga.. <B>Like i said</B>.. you just caught me at a low point in my life.. Mr. Sunshine is on a break.. If you think you can cheer mr sunshine up feel free to feel sympathetic.. Go ahead and amuse me, because then again.. how would i know if anyone really cared.. No one ever does.. I'm tired.. I'm gonna go sleep... And then i realized.. These thoughts were so much clearer to me while i was cleaning the pool... I get it now.. I see the connecting between cleaning the shit out and well... me.. i don't wanna deal with this anymore.. But considering everything else in the world - i already know i HAVE to.. So i'm putting this xanga on [STOP] for a while God knows how long.. Until i finally make peace with myself again.. I'm not isolating myself from the world.. no.. I'm living it day by day as if i had not a care in the world.<FONT face=impact color=#68a8d8 size=3>//]</DIV></TR></TD></FONT></B></B></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>
