<h3>What makes you happy?</h3>
<!--PREMISE-->
<p class="content">The idea for this equation came from a concept I came up with in 2011 to replace logging daily happenings in a journal with logging daily happenings in a log.  More specifically, instead of writing down sentences, I decided it would be faster to just write down things I did/wanted to do on a given day, and score myself based on how I did those things.  In doing so, I forced myself to take a step back, sit down, and really think on how my day went.</p>

<p class="content">In mid-2011, my journals started looking like this:</p>

<p class="content-image"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hF0ttAP.png?1"><img class="content" src="http://i.imgur.com/hF0ttAP.png?1"></a></p>

<p class="content">As with all things we aim to do daily, I managed to log my days in this Excel sheet about 30 times over half a year.  Although I ended up not logging things as frequently as I could have (at the time it was something I did when I had an extra 20 minutes - and remembered to do it), I continued to log my days throughout 2012 and dubbed the logs "Progress Mathematics".  By 2013, I started tracking my diet and exercise habits as well, and a substantial model began to take form.  I thought up a clever name for my little hobby: HapCap (short for Happiness Capacity). </p>

<p class="content">Throughout 2013, I kept adding onto the Excel sheet as I continued to (try to) keep logs.  Soon enough, I had a working model that could objectively evaluate just how well I met goals I set for myself on a given day, and after playing around with variables and formulae, I eventually arrived at the current iteration of the formula. </p>

<p content="content">It was around this time I began to realize that at least some part of what makes us happy is fundamentally how we succeed and more importantly, how we measure success.  The model I ended up with follows a very simple process that asks 3 simple questions:
<br><blockquote>1) What was your goal?<br>2) How important was it?<br>3) How well did you do it?</blockquote><br>
The beauty behind the model was that everything was subjective.  On one day, eating healthy might be the focus of your day.  On another, your goal might be to eat hotcakes and bacon.  It doesn't matter.  Whatever you deem important becomes objective criteria.</p>

<p class="content"></p>

<p class="content">After playing around with the working model, I found that when things were less important, my score was higher.  Consequently, the less important something is, the easier it is to fulfill it.  This evidently proved to be an ironic flaw in the model; detachment grants you happiness, but it also means filling this thing out is redundant.</p>

<p class="content">The concept behind HapCap is not a far cry from the fundamental concept behind Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs(baser needs/"deficiency needs" must be fulfilled before higher needs can be addressed).  As more important things take precedence over less important things, those secondary priorties are relatively diminished - regardless of how important they were initially.</p>
