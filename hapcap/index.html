<h3>What makes you happy?</h3>
<!--PREMISE-->
<p class="content">The idea for this equation came from a concept I came up with in 2011 to replace logging daily happenings in a journal with logging daily events in a log.  More specifically, instead of writing down sentences, I decided it would be faster to just write down things I did/wanted to do on a given day, and score myself based on how I did those things.  In mid-2011, my journals started looking like this:</p>

<p class="content-image"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hF0ttAP.png"><img class="content" src="http://i.imgur.com/hF0ttAP.png"></a></p>

<p class="content">As with all things we aim to do daily, I managed to log my days in this Excel sheet about 30 times over half a year.  Although I ended up not logging things as frequently as I could have (at the time it was something I did when I had an extra 20 minutes - and remembered to do it), I continued to log my days throughout 2012 and dubbed the logs "Progress Mathematics".  By 2013, I started tracking my diet and exercise habits as well, and a substantial model began to take form.</p>

<p class="content">Throughout 2013, I began to start playing around with variables and formulae.  Soon enough, I had a working model that could objectively evaluate just how well I met goals I set for myself on a given day.</p>

<p content="content">It was around this time I began to realize that at least some part of what makes us happy is fundamentally how we succeed - and more importantly, how we measure success.  The model I ended up with follows a very simple process:
<br><blockquote>1) What did you plan on doing?<br>2) How important was it?<br>3) How well did you do it?</blockquote><br>
The beauty behind the model was that everything was subjective.  On one day, eating healthy might be the focus of your day.  On another, your goal might be to eat hotcakes and bacon.  It doesn't matter.</p>

<p class="content">I eventually conjured up this formula: </p>

<p class="content">One realization I garnered from this model was that the less important things were to me, the higher my score became.  This evidently proved to be an ironic flaw in the model; detachment grants you happiness, but it also means filling this thing out is redundant.</p>

<p class="content">However, this also gives support to the concept of Maslow's Hierarchy.  Less things become important as baser needs are less fulfilled.  As I tracked my goals, I found that health, fitness, and nutrition were consistently significant factors in my daily score.</p>
