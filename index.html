Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale<br />
Hot tamales and they red not, yes, she got 'em for sale<br />
I got a girl, say she long and tall<br />
She sleeps in the kitchen with her feets in the hall<br />
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean<br />
Yes she got 'em for sale, yeah<br />
<br />
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale #They too hot, boy#<br />
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, now, she got 'em for sale<br />
You know the monkey, now the baboon playin' in the grass<br />
Well, the monkey stuck his finger in that old "Good Gulf Gas," now<br />
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean<br />
Yes, she got 'em for sale<br />
<br />
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale<br />
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale<br />
She got two for a nickel, got four for a dime<br />
Would sell you more, but they ain't none of mine<br />
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean<br />
Yes, she got 'em for sale, yes, yeah<br />
<br />
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale<br />
I'm 'onna upset your backbone, put your kidneys to sleep<br />
I'll due to break 'way your liver and dare your heart to beat 'bout my<br />
Hot tamales 'cause they red hot, yes, they got 'em for sale, I mean<br />
Yes, she got 'em for sale, yeah
