Analytics...  According to businessdictionary.com:
>The field of data analysis. Analytics often involves studying past historical data to research potential trends, to analyze the effects of certain decisions or events, or to evaluate the performance of a given tool or scenario. The goal of analytics is to improve the business by gaining knowledge which can be used to make improvements or changes.

So I guess that means this section will contain the follow-ups of work shown on the Data Science page.  Unlike the Economics page, Analytics will contain microeconomic-focused content; Milk is a top-selling item at grocery stores?  Put milk at the back.
